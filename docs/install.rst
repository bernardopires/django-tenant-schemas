==================
Installation
==================
Assuming you have django installed, the first step is to install `django-tenant-schemas`.::

    pip install django-tenant-schemas

Basic Settings
==============
You'll have to make the following modifcations to your `settings.py` file.

Your `DATABASE_ENGINE` setting needs to be changed to::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'tenant_schemas.postgresql_backend',
            # ..
        }
    }
    
Add the middleware `tenant_schemas.middleware.TenantMiddleware` to the top of `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`, so that each request can be set to use the correct schema.::
    
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'tenant_schemas.middleware.TenantMiddleware',
        #...
    )
    
The Tenant Model
================
Now we have to create your tenant model. To allow the flexibility of having any data in you want in your tenant, we have a mixin called `TenantMixin` which you *have to* inherit from. This Mixin only has two fields (`domain_url` and `schema_name`) and both are required. Here's an example, suppose we have an app named `customers` and we want to create a model called `client`.::

    from django.db import models
    from tenant_schemas.models import TenantMixin
    
    class Client(TenantMixin):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        paid_until =  models.DateField()
        on_trial = models.BooleanField()
        created_on = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
        
        # default true, schema will be automatically created and synced when it is saved
        auto_create_schema = True 

Configure Tenant and Shared Applications
========================================
By default all apps will be synced to your `public` schema and to your tenant schemas. If you want to make use of shared and tenant-specific applications, there are two additional settings called `SHARED_APPS` and `TENANT_APPS`. `SHARED_APPS` is a tuple of strings just like `INSTALLED_APPS` and should contain all apps that you want to be synced to `public`. If `SHARED_APPS` is set, then these are the only apps that will be to your `public` schema! The same applies for `TENANT_APPS`, it expects a tuple of strings where each string is an app. If set, only those applications will be synced to all your tenants. Here's a sample setting::

    SHARED_APPS = (
        'tenant_schemas',  # mandatory
        'customers', # you must list the app where your tenant model resides in
        
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
         
        # everything below here is optional
        'django.contrib.auth', 
        'django.contrib.sessions', 
        'django.contrib.sites', 
        'django.contrib.messages', 
        'django.contrib.admin', 
    )
    
    TENANT_APPS = (
        # The following Django contrib apps must be in TENANT_APPS
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',

        # your tenant-specific apps
        'myapp.hotels',
        'myapp.houses', 
    )

    INSTALLED_APPS = SHARED_APPS + TENANT_APPS
    
.. warning::

   As of now it's not possible to have a centralized `django.contrib.auth`.

You also have to set where your tenant model is.::

    TENANT_MODEL = "customers.Client" # app.Model
    
Now run `sync_schemas`, this will create the shared apps on the `public` schema. Note: your database should be empty if this is the first time you're running this command.::

    python manage.py sync_schemas --shared
    
.. warning::

   Never use `syncdb` as it would sync *all* your apps to `public`!
    
Lastly, you need to create a tenant whose schema is `public` and it's address is your domain URL. Please see the section on :doc:`use <use>`.

South Migrations
================
This app supports `South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_  so if you haven't configured it yet and would like to:

For Django 1.1 or below::

    SOUTH_DATABASE_ADAPTER = 'south.db.postgresql_psycopg2'

For Django 1.2 or above::

    SOUTH_DATABASE_ADAPTERS = {
        'default': 'south.db.postgresql_psycopg2',
    }
    
You can list `south` under `TENANT_APPS` and `SHARED_APPS` if you want.

We override `south`'s `syncdb` and `migrate` command, so you'll need to change your `INSTALLED_APPS` to ::

    INSTALLED_APPS = SHARED_APPS + TENANT_APPS + ('tenant_schemas',)
    
This makes sure `tenant_schemas` is the last on the list and therefore always has precedence when running an overriden command.

Optional Settings
=================
By default `PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URL_TOKEN` is set to `None`, which means you can't serve different views on the same path. To be able to have tenant URL routing see the section below.

Tenant View-Routing
-------------------
We have a goodie called `PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URLCONF`. Suppose you have your main website at `example.com` and a customer at `customer.example.com`. You probably want your user to be routed to different views when someone requests `http://example.com/` and `http://customer.example.com/`. Because django only uses the string after the host name, this would be impossible, both would call the view at `/`. This is where `PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URLCONF` comes in handy. If set, when the `public` schema is being requested, the value of this variable will be used instead of `ROOT_URLCONF <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-ROOT_URLCONF>`_. So for example, if you have::

    PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URLCONF = 'myproject.urls_public'
    
When requesting the view `/login/` from the public tenant (your main website), it will search for this path on `PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URLCONF` instead of `ROOT_URLCONF`. 

Different WSGI for the main website
-----------------------------------
If you have a more complex setup in your project, using the `PUBLIC_SCHEMA_URLCONF` can be difficult.
For example, `Django CMS <https://www.django-cms.org/>`_ want to take some control over the default Django url routing, and uses different middlewares, which the tenant websites don't need.
Another example is when you put apps on the main website, which needs different settings than tenant websites.
In these cases it might be much simpler if you just run the main website `example.com` as a separate wsgi application. For example, creating a `wsgi_main_website.py` next to the `wsgi.py` like this::

    # wsgi_main_website.py
    import os
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "project.settings_public")

    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    application = get_wsgi_application()

If you put this in the same Django project, you can make a new ``settings_public.py`` which points to a different ``urls_public.py``. This has the advantage that you can use the same apps than you use for tenant websites.

Or you can do a totally separate project for the main website, but be aware that if you specify a PostgreSQL database in the ``DATABASES`` setting in ``settings.py``, Django will use it's default ``public`` schema as `described in the PostgreSQL documentation <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PUBLIC>`_.

Building Documentation
======================
Documentation is available in ``docs`` and can be built into a number of 
formats using `Sphinx <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx>`_. To get started::

    pip install Sphinx
    cd docs
    make html

This creates the documentation in HTML format at ``docs/_build/html``.
