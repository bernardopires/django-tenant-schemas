Multi-Threading
---------------
This is being used right now in production on a small project and I have made an attempt to make it thread-safe, but I'm a complete beginner at this subject. Any help on this would be *HIGHLY* appreciated. Can someone please check if the custom `postgresql_backend <https://github.com/bcarneiro/django-tenant-schemas/blob/master/tenant_schemas/postgresql_backend/base.py>`_ is thread-safe? If there is a way to write a test for this, it would be awesome. Please send in your feedback at `issue #2 <https://github.com/bcarneiro/django-tenant-schemas/issues/2>`_.

To-Do
-----
Take a look at `tenant_schemas/tests/schemas.py <https://github.com/bcarneiro/django-tenant-schemas/blob/master/tenant_schemas/tests/tenants.py>`_ and search for the string `todo`.  Please send in your feedback at `issue #4 <https://github.com/bcarneiro/django-tenant-schemas/issues/4>`_.
