Running the tests

If you're using South, don't forget to set ``SOUTH_TESTS_MIGRATE = False``.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py test tenant_schemas.tests

Updating your app's tests to work with tenant-schemas
-----------------------------------------------------
Because django will not create tenants for you during your tests, we have packed some custom test cases and other utilities. If you want a test to happen at any of the tenant's domain, you can use the test case ``TenantTestCase``. It will automatically create a tenant for you, set the connection's schema to tenant's schema and make it available at ``self.tenant``. We have also included a ``TenantRequestFactory`` and a ``TenantClient`` so that your requests will all take place at the tenant's domain automatically. Here's an example

.. code-block:: python

    from tenant_schemas.test.cases import TenantTestCase
    from tenant_schemas.test.client import TenantClient

    class BaseSetup(TenantTestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            self.c = TenantClient(self.tenant)
            
        def test_user_profile_view(self):
            response = self.c.get(reverse('user_profile'))
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
