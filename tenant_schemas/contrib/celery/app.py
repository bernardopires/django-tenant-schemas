"""
Implementation of schema-aware celery application.
Usage:
    * Define a celery app using given `CeleryApp` class.

        ::
            import os
            os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'app.settings')

            from django.conf import settings

            from tenant_schemas.contrib.celery.app import CeleryApp

            app = CeleryApp()
            app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings')
            app.autodiscover_tasks(lambda: settings.INSTALLED_APPS)

      This assumes a fresh Celery 3.1.12 application. For previous versions,
      the key is to create a new `CeleryApp` instance that will be used to
      access task decorator from.

    * Replace your @task decorator with @app.task

        ::
            from django.db import connection
            from myproject.celery import app

            @app.task
            def my_task():
                print connection.schema_name

    * Run celery worker (`myproject.celery` is where you've defined the `app`
      variable)

        ::
            $ celery worker -A myproject.celery

    * Post registered task. The schema name will get automatically added to the
      task's arguments.

        ::
            from myproject.tasks import my_task
            my_task.delay()

The `TenantTask` class transparently inserts current connection's schema into
the task's kwargs. The schema name is then popped from the task's kwargs in
`task_prerun` signal handler, and the connection's schema is changed
accordingly.
